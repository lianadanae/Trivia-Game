# Trivia-Game
US Capitals Quiz

For this Javascript homework assignment I created a trivia quiz form with questions and multiple choice options using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

The player can not pick more than one answer per question.

A countdown timer is included.
